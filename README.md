# Spartan-Messenger

The aim is to build a response-streaming RPC where the client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. The client reads from the returned stream until there are no more messages. As one can see in the example, one specifies a response-streaming method by placing the stream keyword before the response type. // Obtains the Features available within the given Rectangle. Results are // streamed rather than returned at once (e.g. in a response message with a // repeated field), as the rectangle may cover a large area and contain a // huge number of features.

rpc ReceiveMsg(Message) returns (stream Message) {} 
Features

Implemented a LRU Cache to store recent messages in memory. ðŸ’¾
Limited the number of messages a user can send to an API within a time window e.g., 15 requests per second. NOTE: The rate limiting works for a distributed setup. ðŸš¦

Provided end-to-end message encryption using AES from PyCrypto library. ðŸ”‘
Added Decorator for the LRU cache (E.g @lru_cache) and rate limition (E.g. @rate) 

App Config
Used given config.yaml to load users for the Spartan messenger.
